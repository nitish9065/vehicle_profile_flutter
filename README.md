App user Flow

Users will land on the vehicle list page, which will be empty for the first time.


Users will first input the vehicle registration number (MH14AB1234). Then the user has to select the vehicle class. The vehicle class can be 2w for two wheeler (bikes and scooters) and 4w (cars). Once this information is collected, a user has to select the make from the list of makes. After selecting the make, a list of models belonging to that make should be prompted. With the combination of make and model. The next screen should ask the user the fuel type (like petrol or diesel). After selecting the fuel type, the user has to select the transmission. Transmission has two options which are “Manual” and “Automatic”.


After selecting the transmission, a vehicle profile will be created and saved locally. The profile will be shown in the Vehicle List screen. Once the item in the vehicle list screen is clicked, it will launch a Vehicle Profile screen where the vehicle information will be displayed in detail.
